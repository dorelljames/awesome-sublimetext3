# AWESOME SUBLIME TEXT 3

## Pre-requisite

- Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (REQUIRED)

Package Control is a package manager for Sublime that allows you to easily install any of the hundreds of awesome plugins made by other developers. The best part is, you’ll never have to leave Sublime to search, install, or remove these.

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (RECOMMENDED)

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

#### Command Palette

This is one of the most used commands. Just popup open the **Command Palette** and search for things like settings, options, syntax, and shortcuts.

```
Apple     ⌘ + ⇧ + p  
Windows   ctrl + shift + p
```

#### Ultra-Fast File Switching

Use this command to navigate to open new files. The search is extremely smart or I call it _GENIUS!_ :D

```
Apple     ⌘ + p  
Windows   ctrl + p
```

#### Go to Symbol / Definition / Method / Function

Sublime Text 3 indexes functions, methods, definitions, etc. so you can search them and easily switch to them.

```
Apple     ⌘ + r  
Windows   ctrl + r
```

#### Search a file then search that page

```
Apple     ⌘ + p then @  
Windows   ctrl + p then @
```

#### Search an entire project

```
Apple     ⌘ + ⇧ + r
Windows   ctrl + shift + r
```

## Make Sublime Text Pretty

To install themes, just use package control. So the process would be:

1. `ctrl + shift + p` or `cmd + shift + p`
2. Look for `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Search for the theme and hit enter. Eg: `material`
4. Set the theme in `Preferences -> Settings – User` by editing the json property called theme
