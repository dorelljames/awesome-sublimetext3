# AWESOME SUBLIME TEXT 3

## PRE-REQUISITE

- Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) (REQUIRED)

  Package Control is a package manager for Sublime that allows you to easily install any of the hundreds of awesome plugins made by other developers. The best part is, you’ll never have to leave Sublime to search, install, or remove these.

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (RECOMMENDED)

  Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

#### Command Palette

This is one of the most used commands. Just popup open the **Command Palette** and search for things like settings, options, syntax, and shortcuts.

```
Apple     ⌘ + ⇧ + p  
Windows   ctrl + shift + p
```

#### Ultra-Fast File Switching

Use this command to navigate to open new files. The search is extremely smart or I call it _GENIUS!_ :D

```
Apple     ⌘ + p  
Windows   ctrl + p
```

#### Go to Symbol / Definition / Method / Function

Sublime Text 3 indexes functions, methods, definitions, etc. so you can search them and easily switch to them.

```
Apple     ⌘ + r  
Windows   ctrl + r
```

#### Search a file then search that page

```
Apple     ⌘ + p then @  
Windows   ctrl + p then @
```

#### Search an entire project

```
Apple     ⌘ + ⇧ + r
Windows   ctrl + shift + r
```

#### Project Management made easy
  
Being able to switch between projects in Sublime is a breeze. It’s super helpful for keeping momentun going while moving to a new task.

```
Apple  	⌘ + ^ + p
Windows	alt + ctrl + p
```

## MAKE SUBLIME TEXT PRETTY

To install themes, just use package control. So the process would be:

1. `ctrl + shift + p` or `cmd + shift + p`
2. Look for `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Search for the theme and hit enter. Eg: `material`
4. Set the theme in `Preferences -> Settings – User` by editing the json property called theme

![Material Theme](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/972bd5d93779fdaf95e02cf0326b429be93adcba/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f395079784a4d4e2e676966)

## RECOMMENDED PLUGINS

1. SUPER FAST FILE CREATION
  
  Install [AdvancedNewFile](https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile) which lets you quickly add a file to an existing folder without having to get a popup to save from Windows, Mac, or your Linux OS. It also allows you to create folders and subfolders to your new file.

2. WHERE'S THAT ENDING BRACKET?

  [BracketHighlighter (or Bracket Highlighter)](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter) is an awesome plugin that helps you see your code more clearly. Not only does it highlight your HTML element’s start and end points, but it also will set markers for all of the following:

  ```
  <tag></tag>
  []
  ()
  ""
  ''
  ```

  The highlighing also includes putting nice icons in your editors gutter by your line numbers.

3. WHO DON'T COPY CODE? BUT HEY TABS AND SPACING GOT MESSED.

  Sublime Text 3 out of the box has a nice utility for reindenting your code automatically. It works really well, too. To access it, simply popup open the Command Palette. However, it doesn’t automatically format it with new lines, beautify minified code, and more. For this you can simply use [HTMLPrettify](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify). It works for HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON files.
